Recommended Learning Path
Week 1-2: Node.js + Express basics (build simple APIs)
Week 3-4: Learn ethers.js - send test ETH on Sepolia testnet
Week 5-6: Understand Bitcoin UTXOs and transactions
Week 7+: Build your own wallet app combining everything
Pro Tip: Always practice on testnets first (Sepolia for ETH, Bitcoin Testnet) before mainnet to avoid losing real money!
